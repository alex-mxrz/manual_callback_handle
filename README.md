- **JSON Settings**: The bot's settings are stored in JSON files, allowing for easy configuration and deployment.
- **Optimized for Triviality**: The example is designed to be as simple as possible, making it easy to understand and modify.
- **Maximized for Automatability**: The bot is designed to handle as many tasks as possible automatically, reducing the need for manual intervention.
